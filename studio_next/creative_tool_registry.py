"""Discover real locally installed creative applications for ONE artistic brain.

Capabilities are tools, not independent decision-making agents or visual
templates. Declaring a tool available does NOT imply the Studio already has
a validated rendering adapter, a GPU, model weights, media rights or premium
results. New locally installed tools can be discovered by updating the data
catalog, without rewriting the Director or applying a predefined art style.

Never accept model-originated shell commands or executable paths.
